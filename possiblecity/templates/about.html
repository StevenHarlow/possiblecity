          <p class="text-center lead-big">Possible City is a collaborative platform that connects <a href="{% url 'profiles_profile_list' %}">people</a>, <a href="{% url 'ideas_idea_list' %}">imagination</a>, skills, and collective resources to transform abandoned <a href="{% url 'lotxlot' %}">spaces</a> into generative places.</p>
            <hr>
                <p class="lead text-center">We're building community dialogue around abandoned spaces with a focus on confronting the digital divide, by posting physical signage on vacant lots to prompt ideas from residents via text, tweet and write-in paper form. At the same time we're engaging artists, designers, urban farmers and small business people to float ideas of their own - and helping them find the constituencies, resources, and people they need to get their projects on the ground.</p>
